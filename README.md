Task
·	Apply all classification model steps on their project or any sample dataset 
·	Solve the end of class exercise
Exercise:
·	Work on your selected dataset by following below steps (watch YouTube video) and using the sample code as well as slides provided for this exercise.
Step 1: Import Needed Libraries
Step 2: Read the experimental dataset
Step (optional): Shuffle the dataset to avoid bias
Step 3: Perform Data Engineering (Data Pre-processing) Steps
Step 4: Verify if the Target Class is Balance or Not
Step 5: Split the Data into Training and Test Sets
Step 6: Apply Feature Selections (graphically) to Reduce the Dimensions
Step (optional): Apply SMOTE to Balance the Target Class
Step 7: Write some Common useful functions for Classification
	a) K-Fold Cross Validation
	b) Plot Training and Test Dataset
  c) Plot Confusion Matrix
	d) Plot AUC ROC Curve
	e) Feature Importance
Step 8: Apply below listed common Classification Models
	a) Logistic regression
	b) Support Vector Machine
	c) K-Nearest Neighbor
	d) Naive Bayes
	e) Decision Tree
Step 9: Evaluate the performance of all the Classification Models (Graphically)
Step 10: Select and Conclude the best performing classification model for the given dataset

Deliverables(s)
 Submit the python code file along with their selected data file. The file should clearly show how students performed various steps including data engineering, data classification, evaluation and conclusions on the best performing classification method.
